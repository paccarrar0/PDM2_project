## Database Modeling

## Database Modeling

The database consists of three main tables: `users`, `compositions`, and `versions`. The structure is designed to support an offline music production organizer app where users can manage and store their musical ideas and related files.

### `users`
Stores information about the app user.

| Field           | Type    | Description                        |
|----------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `id`            | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-incremented)     |
| `name`          | TEXT    | User's name                        |
| `profile_image` | TEXT    | Path or URI to profile picture     |

---

### `compositions`
Stores the compositions created or imported by the user.

| Field           | Type    | Description                                |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-incremented)             |
| `user_id`       | INTEGER | Foreign key linking to `users(id)`         |
| `title`         | TEXT    | Title of the composition                   |
| `lyrics_file`   | TEXT    | Path to lyrics file (.txt or .pdf)         |
| `sheet_file`    | TEXT    | Path to sheet music or tablature image     |
| `audio_file`    | TEXT    | Path to an audio file                      |
| `cover_image`   | TEXT    | Optional cover image for the composition   |
| `notes`         | TEXT    | Freeform notes about the composition       |
| `created_at`    | TEXT    | Date the composition was created           |
| `updated_at`    | TEXT    | Date the composition was last updated      |

---

### `versions`
Each composition can have multiple versions (e.g., drafts, arrangements, remixes).

| Field            | Type    | Description                                |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-incremented)             |
| `composition_id` | INTEGER | Foreign key linking to `compositions(id)`  |
| `version_title`  | TEXT    | Title or label for the version             |
| `lyrics_file`    | TEXT    | Path to version-specific lyrics            |
| `sheet_file`     | TEXT    | Path to version-specific sheet/tab         |
| `audio_file`     | TEXT    | Path to version-specific audio             |
| `notes`          | TEXT    | Notes related to this version              |
| `created_at`     | TEXT    | Date this version was created              |
